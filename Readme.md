Aqua provides a modular, extensible framework for building MQTT servers in Rust. By leveraging the Tower service architecture, it enables a clean separation of concerns between connection handling, protocol processing, and business logic. The system's components are designed to be composable and reusable, facilitating customization for different use cases. For developers looking to implement custom MQTT brokers, Aqua offers a foundation that handles the complexities of the MQTT protocol while providing integration points for application-specific functionality.
